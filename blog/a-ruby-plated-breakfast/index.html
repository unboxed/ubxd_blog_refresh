            <p>July saw our CTO, Andrew White host the Ruby on Rails 4.2 networking breakfast, right here at Unboxed Consulting HQ.</p>

<p>Members of the Ruby community attended this one-off session to hear what’s coming in Rails 4.2, straight from our very own Ruby on Rails contributor and Rails Core Team Member.</p>

<p><img alt="Breakfast" src="http://i62.tinypic.com/2057dcx.png" /></p>

<p>The morning began with a delicious standing breakfast, giving everyone the chance to meet, chat and mingle. This was a fantastic opportunity for to introduce our London office and members of the team.</p>

<p>Andrew then took to the floor to guide us through the upcoming changes in Ruby on Rails 4.2, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Active Job framework</li>
<li>Action Pack</li>
<li>Active Support</li>
<li>Railties</li>
</ul>

<p>The timeline of release was also discussed, which included the beta release, release candidate and final release dates.</p>

<p><img alt="Breakfast2" src="http://i59.tinypic.com/25pkfon.png" /></p>

<p>We were also taken through the various student programs available, such as Google Summer of Code and Facebook OpenAcademy, which help gain awareness of Rails opportunities to students.</p>

<p>To finish, a Q&amp;A session with the audience took place. The issue of a lack of Rails contribution from the UK Ruby community was raised, with there being a notable lack of UK contribution compared to that of other worldwide Ruby communities.</p>

<p><img alt="Breakfast3" src="http://i57.tinypic.com/303fzuh.png" /></p>

<p>The session then came to a close with Andrew answering individual questions and reflecting further on what had been discussed in the Q&amp;A session.</p>

<p><em>“It was a great opportunity to host this event, especially in our offices. I thoroughly enjoyed meeting members of the Ruby community face-to-face and it was also very beneficial to find out members’ thoughts of how to encourage Rails contributions from the UK Ruby community”</em> – Andrew White</p>
