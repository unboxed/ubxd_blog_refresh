            <p>The Agile News you need</p>

<hr>

<h3>Scaling</h3>

<p>Our first contribution is from Richard Stobart, who has found an
 interesting article on <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/10/26/what-weve-learnt-about-scaling-agile/">scaling agile in the UK government.</a> UK.GOV
 was delivered by 140 people in 14 teams. Some valuable ideas on how to monitor progress and how to organise at the portfolio level.</p>

<h3>Retrospective Check-in</h3>

<p>Austin Fagan has found a great <a href="http://facilitatingagility.com/2012/03/15/facilitation-toolkit-activities-for-check-in/">rundown of activities</a> you can use as
 the start of your retrospective. This assumes you’re using the 5 stage retrospective plan outlined by Diana Larson and Esther Derby in their great book, “Agile Retrospectives”.</p>

<h3>The Tao of Agile</h3>

<p>Another from Austin; what must have been a fairly lengthy <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/tangram77/the-tao-of-agile-xp2012">lightning
 talk by Fabio Armani</a> at XP2012 discusses the holistic vs.
 reductionist mindset and how first Lean and later Agile has helped us
 move beyond this mindset.</p>

<h3>Complexity in Agile</h3>

<p>Ben Wong has found this simple <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mqNcs8mp74">introduction to the Cynefin
 Framework.</a> The framework has made a significant impact on the Lean
 and Agile conversations since CALMAlpha earlier this year. It has
 particular value as a model for organisational change. But, Ben has also
 found this workshop from <a href="http://lunivore.com/">Liz Keogh</a> where she uses the model in
 tandem with Deliberate Discovery and Real Options to help teams discover
 where the need or moment of commitment happens.</p>

<h3>Agile Product Ownership</h3>

<p>Carlo Kruger was particularly impressed by this short <a href="http://blog.crisp.se/2012/10/25/henrikkniberg/agile-product-ownership-in-a-nutshell">presentation on
 Product Ownership</a> from Henrik Kniberg. There is also a text version
 on the page for those of you allergic to video, but his hand drawn
 video really communicates some of the concepts that many people seem to
 have trouble with.</p>

<h3>The Life of the Agile Tester</h3>

<p>Sam and Karen at <a href="http://www.growningagile.co.za">Growing Agile</a> gave a talk this past week on how the
 <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/growingagile/agile-affair-between-devs-testers">role of a tester</a> plays out in an agile team. Lots of practical
 advice and a discussion on what life is like without an issue tracker!</p>

<h3>It’s Ordered, not Prioritised!</h3>

<p>Sarah Beck has found a <a href="http://scrumalliance.com/articles/447-product-backlog-ordering-not-prioritization">great follow up</a> to Jim Coplien’s discussion
 of the recent changes to the <a href="http://scrum.org/Scrum-Guides">Scrum Guide</a> which uses the term
 “ordered” as opposed to what was used before, “prioritised”.</p>

<h3>Poor IT delivery may not be our fault?</h3>

<p>Linda Rising, noted author, gave the keynote address at Agile Connect
 2011, where she discusses how our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvhOXU72OL4">ancestors might be responsible for
 our poor estimates and IT delivery.</a></p>
