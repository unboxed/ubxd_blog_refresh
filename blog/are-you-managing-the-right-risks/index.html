            Are you managing the right risks?
          </h1>

          <div class="blog-article__content">
            <p>I was talking to a very good Project Manager the other day. We were talking about the risks that a Project Manager manages in the delivery of software.  </p>

<p>In a traditional project, the risks <strong>managed</strong> are often not actually the <strong>biggest</strong> risks that project will have. Some possible risks that the project will have are:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The thing you’re building will not be used to generate the benefit you think it will deliver (this is the <strong>biggest</strong> risk)  </p></li>
<li><p>What you’re building will not be liked by customers – it won’t solve their problems  </p></li>
<li><p>They’ll find something better or something that is available sooner but is not-as-good, which they’ll start using and be reluctant to switch from this to your product  </p></li>
<li><p>The thing that you deliver will have obvious <em>‘gotcha’</em>s: once you see it working, you’ll realise it would never have worked the way you’d envisioned  </p></li>
<li><p>People use it in a way that you would never have imagined and you have to change all your future features based on how people are actually using it</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="Tech risks" src="http://bit.ly/1GhaOLy" /></p>

<h2>Technical risks</h2>

<p>The other sorts of risks the project will have are technical risks:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>It will never scale  </p></li>
<li><p>The development team you have in place aren’t capable of delivering a solution  </p></li>
<li><p>The amount they quoted to do this is nowhere <strong>near</strong> enough to deliver it  </p></li>
<li><p>The software you’re using is not fit for purpose  </p></li>
<li><p>The production environment won’t be ready in time  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>And how about&hellip;  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The various components you’ve been building don’t integrate well together – one development team has misunderstood how the interface to the other development team’s work will work. One team is sending apples and the other team is expecting oranges.  </p></li>
<li><p>The amount of things you have to prepare in I&amp;O (Infrastructure &amp; Operations), security or pre-production are so numerous and you didn’t realise you had so many hurdles to jump over before you could put this into production.  </p></li>
<li><p>The requirements you’ve received have now gone out-of-date and are stale. You had a team working on the requirements, they haven’t synched and some requirements documents have been moved forward after review and others haven’t. The whole thing doesn’t string together, end-to-end.  </p></li>
<li><p>What you thought was absolutely critical, when you were writing the requirements document, turns out to be irrelevant in the new world.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="The team" src="http://bit.ly/1Rmj2bC" /></p>

<h2>An Agile approach</h2>

<p>These are the sorts of risks that an Agile approach highlights early on. Agile gets a bad reputation for pointing out that there are all these risks. People don’t like seeing a lot of risk. They prefer to do something in a more <em>“risk-free”</em> environment where things are steadier and planned further.  </p>

<p>All we’re really doing is pushing the risks that we know exist under the carpet and revisiting them later.  </p>

<p>Agile means we see the risks that are already there (whether we choose to look directly at them or not), understand them and change tack quickly before the risk becomes a product-halting problem.</p>
