            Can You Digg It

            <p>Are you ready for this week&rsquo;s feature filled fiasco? I know I am! So fasten your seat belts, tie your hair back and prepare for an emotional roller coaster of developer developments.</p>

<h2>Diggsaster (Chris P)</h2>

<p>Digg sells for half a million dollars (reportedly). They should have cashed in on the $200 million Google offered them in 2008.</p>

<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5925586/digg-sells-itself-for-pathetic-pocketchange-500000">http://gizmodo.com/5925586/digg-sells-itself-for-pathetic-pocketchange-500000</a></p>

<h2>Clandestine communication (Chris P)</h2>

<p>&ldquo;I bumped into a raggedy dressed man as we got on [the subway] and he shot me a quick smile. I [thought] nothing of it until he went to get off at 14th street and he handed me a $50 bill along with a note. Before I could even open my mouth to ask him a question, he was gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://mashable.com/2012/07/11/reddit-subway-code">http://mashable.com/2012/07/11/reddit-subway-code</a></p>

<h2>Bender, bend to my will (Chris P)</h2>

<p>Our friendly campfire bot has been misbehaving this week. I wrote some (hacky) code that allows arbitrary chunks of ruby to evaluated. This has led to a very noisy developer room (apologies for that).</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in how this works, or would like to get an idea of how to add new actions to our bot, this commit might be of interest.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/unboxed/unbot/commit/3f008d232b4330a0bbff9414d64f291884c540cf">https://github.com/unboxed/unbot/commit/3f008d232b4330a0bbff9414d64f291884c540cf</a></p>

<h2>Retinafying websites (Murray)</h2>

<p>A flowchart about how to retinafy websites (not just images). Seems comprehensive and probably useful.</p>

<p><a href="http://mir.aculo.us/2012/06/26/flowchart-how-to-retinafy-your-website/">http://mir.aculo.us/2012/06/26/flowchart-how-to-retinafy-your-website/</a></p>

<h2>Audio Experimentation (Robert F)</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been dabbling in low level audio processing for iOS and stumbled upon this: <a href="https://github.com/alexbw/novocaine">https://github.com/alexbw/novocaine</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a wrapper around Audio Unit Hosting using Core Audio. Essentially, it makes getting raw audio from the microphone simple and FAST!</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve been very prolific with regards to speaking at events recently, so I have two slid decks to punt.</p>

<p>A story about the ethos of Resque and when to use it: <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/robertfall/resque-the-journey">https://speakerdeck.com/robertfall/resque-the-journey</a></p>

<p>As well as:</p>

<p>iOS Web Apps and how to make them look native: <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/robertfall/ios-web-apps-the-journey">https://speakerdeck.com/robertfall/ios-web-apps-the-journey</a></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll see common thread between the two talks. Perhaps I should expand it into a series of &ldquo;The Journey&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Another thing: <a href="https://github.com/petejkim/underscore.objc/">https://github.com/petejkim/underscore.objc/</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a port of the underscore.js library to Obj-C. It&rsquo;s particularly useful in iOS development where you have to do almost everything by hand.</p>

<h2>HTML5 Sortable (Robert P)</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/farhadi/html5sortable">https://github.com/farhadi/html5sortable</a></p>

<p>Nice and easy to use sorting jQuery plugin with IE8 support</p>

<h2>Bootstrap Tour (Robert P)</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/pushly/bootstrap-tour">https://github.com/pushly/bootstrap-tour</a></p>

<p>With some nice animations it could be very powerful and useful - even for cookie notifications.</p>

<h2>CSS Transforms and IndexedDB unprefixed in Firefox (Robert P)</h2>

<p>The unprefixing starts and it&rsquo;s great, because it means that the css3 transform implementations are now in a final stage. They also removed the prefix from indexedDB, which is quite cool and shows that they want to stick with it..</p>

<p><a href="http://paulrouget.com/e/transformsunprefixed/">http://paulrouget.com/e/transformsunprefixed/</a></p>

<h2>Adobe Shadow (Robert P)</h2>

<p>This is another tool from Adobe (boo), which actually makes sense. Download the app, get the iPhone (or Android) app and the Chrome extension. The apps make a bridge across your phone and the computer and whatever you&rsquo;re browsing in Chrome you instantly see it on your phone. Very promising stuff if you&rsquo;re into mobile optimisation and responsive testing.</p>

<h2>That&rsquo;s it&hellip;</h2>

<p>Not the longest newsletter this week, probably due to this developer day. Have a great weekend guys.</p>
