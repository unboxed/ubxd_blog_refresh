            <p>Long Error messages - Matt P
 ==
 Error handling notwithstanding, usually developers try not to have our code generate error messages if we can at all help it. But turning that tenet on its head is <a href="http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/1956/generate-the-longest-error-message-in-c">this stackoverflow post</a> which explores a few attempts at generating intentionally long error messages.</p>

<p>Vagrant 1.1 available with a VMware Fusion provider - Attila
 ==
 <a href="http://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vagrant-1-1-and-vmware.html">http://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vagrant-1-1-and-vmware.html</a></p>

<p>I have been waiting for the new Vagrant release for quite a while, mostly because of the hugely anticipated VMWare Fuison compatibility.
 Yesterday HashiCorp have announced the new release, as soon as I&rsquo;ve seen <a href="https://twitter.com/hashicorp/status/312235310564114434">the tweet</a> I was thinking: Yesssss, finally I get to automate my Fusion VMs with ease.</p>

<p>Clicking through the link, reading through the announcement and BANG! Vagrant&rsquo;s still open source and free (as it should be), however if you want to <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/vmware">use it with Fusion</a>, you&rsquo;d need to pay a significant amount of money. A single seat costs $79 which means that provider is ironically more expensive than Fusion itself.
 On top of that unfortunately it only supports Fusion version 5, which means people who are still using version 4 would need to upgrade to version 5 first, then purchase the Vagrant provider, which means that this solution can get quite expensive very quickly.</p>

<p>I understand that the development costs of Vargant shomehow need to be covered, but honestly I&rsquo;m a little bit disappointed with the price itself.</p>

<p>On the other hand however, Vagrant core is still free and the provider interface is fully open source and <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/plugins/providers.html">documented</a>, allowing for plugins to implement new providers.</p>

<p>Node 0.10.0 is out - Pawel
 ==</p>

<p>A new version of Node.js is out with a new <a href="http://blog.nodejs.org/2013/03/11/node-v0-10-0-stable">stable release</a>. Version 0.10.0 has quite a few API fixes and tweaks and general polishing up, and is geared towards ease of use, and backwards compatibility. </p>

<p>Rebuilding Rails - Pawel
 ==
 It looks like the final version of the <a href="http://rebuilding-rails.com/">Rebuilding Rails</a> book is out. The book guides you through building your own MVC ruby web framework. There are 2 free chapters available.</p>
