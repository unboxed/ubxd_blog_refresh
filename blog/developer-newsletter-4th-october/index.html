            <h2>High speed deploys using Git - <a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/andrew-mitchell">Andy M</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2013/10/02/high-speed-rails-deploys-with-git/">http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2013/10/02/high-speed-rails-deploys-with-git/</a></p>

<p>This article covers some of the ways in which we can use Git to speeed up our deploy. It talks about Capistrano&rsquo;s design before the days of Git and has some interesting points. I have noticed on some projects are deploys sometimes take anything up to 15 minutes on certain projects. It&rsquo;s time to stop wasting time watching capistrano outputs and spend more time coding!</p>

<p>## Why Ruby? - <a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/andrew-mitchell">Andy M</a>
 <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2013/03/why-ruby.html">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2013/03/why-ruby.html</a></p>

<p>I have heard a couple of people asking why use ruby over other languages recently (or why rails). I don&rsquo;t agree with every point here but some of the points are really well made.</p>

<h2>Collaborative audio online - <a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/andrew-mitchell">Andy M</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://open.bekk.no/making-a-collaborative-piano-using-functional-reactive-programming-frp">http://open.bekk.no/making-a-collaborative-piano-using-functional-reactive-programming-frp</a></p>

<p>As I am sure some people have seen I&rsquo;m big into my music and online music collaboration. Check this out… its pretty cool. It kind of discusses some similar ideas to my <a href="http://www.sound-wav.es">sound-wav.es</a> collaborative sequencer idea but it&rsquo;s a bit of a different take!</p>

<h2>Absurd.js - Writing CSS in JavaScript - Veronika H</h2>

<p><a href="http://davidwalsh.name/write-css-javascript">http://davidwalsh.name/write-css-javascript</a></p>

<p>Krasimir Tsonev loves JS so much he wrote absurd.js, a module which lets him write his CSS in node.js modules and then converts it into CSS via JSON objects. Absurd.js has a few nice features like more efficient overrides and combining of selectors, which make the css output look and potentially perform better. It&rsquo;s also flexible in the way you can nest mixing. However, the source looks pretty messy as quotes are required around some selectors and properties, so it&rsquo;s not great for readability.</p>

<h2>When is uniq not unique? - Matt P</h2>

<p><a href="http://chrisholtz.com/blog/more-than-you-care-to-know-about-the-uniq-method/">http://chrisholtz.com/blog/more-than-you-care-to-know-about-the-uniq-method/</a></p>

<p>Did you know that Array#uniq can take a block? Why might you want to invent your own test of uniqueness? The author of this article doesn&rsquo;t know, but nevertheless it&rsquo;s a fun idea to explore.</p>

<h2>Rubyists love DSLs - Matt P</h2>

<p>Sometimes it can seem like Ruby has a DSL for everything. <a href="https://github.com/andrewberls/regularity">Regularity</a> is a DSL for regular expressions. I personally prefer the standard form but I can see the uses for a DSL. Perhaps you prefer the more declarative nature, or perhaps they&rsquo;re useful for pedagogical purposes for newcomers to programming who may not have encountered regular expressions before. Whatever your thoughts, more details can be found on the github project page at <a href="https://github.com/andrewberls/regularity">https://github.com/andrewberls/regularity</a></p>
