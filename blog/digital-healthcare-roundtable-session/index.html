<p><img alt="healthcare0" src="http://i1291.photobucket.com/albums/b548/grammccram/DSC01779_zpsd4fmmo16.jpg" /></p>

<p>The session brought together a handpicked and diverse group of healthcare experts and leaders, with the aim to start a revolution in digital healthcare. Ideas were explored and exchanged about how we can do more to improve public health with digital technology, in this one-off discussion.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/martyn-evans">Martyn Evans</a> and <a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/carrie-bedingfield">Carrie Bedingfield</a> both attended from Unboxed Consulting, with Carrie chairing the session.  </p>

<p>With everyone comfortably seated, the discussion was opened, addressing the initial questions:  </p>

<p>• <em>Why is healthcare still so clunky?</em>  </p>

<p>• <em>How can we dramatically improve the patient experience and the patient outcomes using the power of technology?</em>  </p>

<p>The session&rsquo;s three speakers each presented:</p>

<h2>Presenter 1: Kumar Jacob MBE, Principal Consultant at KJx</h2>

<p>Kumar is currently leading an initiative to bring to life the innovative use of technology in mental healthcare.  </p>

<h2>Presenter 2: Thomas Whicher, Co-Founder at DrDoctor</h2>

<p>With a background in operational improvement, Tom worked in several hospitals delivering multimillion-pound savings, before setting up DrDoctor.  </p>

<h2>Presenter 3: Ian Drysdale, CTO at GoodGym</h2>

<p>As CTO of GoodGym, Ian is using software and design to address problems associated with ageing.  </p>

<p>With the presentations wrapped up, the session then moved on, gathering ideas for the following discussion topics, with each topic voted being on:  </p>
