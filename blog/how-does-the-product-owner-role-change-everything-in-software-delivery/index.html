            How does the Product Owner role change everything in software delivery?
          </h1>

          <div class="blog-article__content">
            <p>I was having a conversation with one of our Agile coaches, who has a long history of project management delivery. We were discussing:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Who owns the successful delivery of value of the features in a traditional project approach?</em>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the answer is:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It falls between the gaps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.prince2.com">PRINCE2</a> world, you have:</p>

<p><img alt="PRINCE2" src="http://bit.ly/1Ml9VHn" /></p>

<h2>1. An IT project manager</h2>

<p>They generally deliver the solution.  </p>

<h2>2. A business project manager</h2>

<p>They deliver the business components required to support the solution, re-structure the business process, get everyone set up to start using the solution and make sure the training is in place.  </p>

<h2>3. A steering group</h2>

<p>This group is there to pull the strings and make sure that the project is delivering against the business case.  </p>

<p>However, all these things fall apart at the end of a project. You do your <em>‘ta-da!’</em> release that delivers everything, everyone congratulates each other on a slightly late but effective delivery of the project, and then they go back to their day jobs.  </p>

<p>No one owns the delivery of the business case, which is why the project was initially justified.  </p>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>Choose a Product Owner.  </p>

<p><img alt="Product Owner" src="http://bit.ly/1BKwHCk" /></p>

<p>Give them the budget to deliver what they need to deliver to make the business case work.  </p>

<p>They might not be interested in delivering the lower value / higher cost features that were originally in the scoping document. They’re interested in delivering, as soon as possible, the one or two high value features that:  </p>

<ul>
<li>De-risk the project</li>
<li>Start generating revenue</li>
<li>Validate that customers want it</li>
<li>Start getting some traction in the business and market</li>
</ul>

<p>Only once they get that traction will they then be willing to invest more to deliver the next set of features.  </p>

<p>More importantly, they will learn what the next most-valuable set of features are, only once the first set of features are actually seen working in production (or <em>not</em> working in production).  </p>

<p>Make sure your project is set up with a Product Owner (or a business project manager) that is solely dedicated to making sure that the benefits are <em>delivered</em>. The benefits are easier to deliver if you have a lower cost overhead for them. So if the person is empowered to make decisions on which benefits can be delivered for which spend, then they will naturally deliver <strong>only</strong> the highest value / lowest cost items.  </p>

<p>It’s important to view your project as a set of features, some of which are:  </p>

<p><img alt="Value and cost" src="http://bit.ly/1GksEUs" /></p>

<p>It’s also important to understand the return on your investment for each feature. You don&rsquo;t want to deliver the features that are going to cost you a lot and not deliver any value.  </p>

<p>The value is delivered in terms of either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cash in the bank from revenue generated</li>
<li>De-risking internally or externally</li>
<li>De-risking the technical solution</li>
</ul>

<p>So assess the value but, more importantly, empower someone to deliver on that value and look at outcomes, <strong>not</strong> scope.</p>
