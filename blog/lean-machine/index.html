            <h2>Lean Enterprise</h2>

<p>Over the last 8 weeks, <a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/blog/author/tom-dickinson">Tom D</a> and I
 (<a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/blog/author/chris-carter">Chris</a>) have been taking a break from our regular design
 and development day jobs. We joined forces with Toby, the product owner from
 <a href="http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/"><em>Naturejobs</em></a>, and Paul at <a href="http://leanmammoth.com">Lean Mammoth</a> to
 identify potentially worthwhile features for the users of the popular science jobs platform using Lean principles and
 methods.</p>

<p><img alt="Team" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47884585/Lean%20Photos/nj_team.JPG" /></p>

<h3>New features</h3>

<p>The process was initiated by the compilation of a list of possible improvements, additional features and completely new
 innovative ideas that had been amassed over the previous months within the company. In order to make the most of our
 time, we picked two potential improvements on which to concentrate. One was an evolutionary feature to be added to their
 existing site and the other an innovative idea which would allow<em>Naturejobs</em> to diversify their offering.</p>

<p>Initially we concentrated solely on the evolutionary stream, focusing our customer segment on the employers who post
 jobs on the<em>Naturejobs</em> platform. We generated a few of the possible “problems&quot; that we thought they might have been
 facing and undertook an &ldquo;experiment” involving numerous phone interviews with existing<em>Naturejobs</em> users exploring a
 particular problem topic. The experiments were structured in the form of a specific hypothesis with one vital assumption
 and the point of the experiment was to test the hypothesis by proving or disproving that assumption. In order to keep
 track of our experiments we used the <a href="http://www.javelin.com/experiment-board.html">Javelin Experiment Board</a>.</p>

<p>After many hours on the phone, 4 full experiments and 32 interviews, we hit a wall. The targeted customer segment simply
 didn&rsquo;t have a problem with the experience or the service provided by<em>Naturejobs</em>! Apart from the very occasional gripe
 with minor interface issues, users were generally very happy with the response to their jobs posts and the speed in
 which they managed to fill their roles. At this point we decided to take a step back and look more at the business as we
 were struggling to identify employer problems to solve.</p>

<p><img alt="Problems" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47884585/Lean%20Photos/problems.JPG" /></p>

<p>The site provides a number of paid upgrades to job posters which aim to improve the visibility of their posts in various
 ways. Looking back at the copious notes which we had taken down from each individual interview it seemed that upgrades
 were being overlooked. Uptake of these upgrades was very low and we decided that it was time to change our problem focus
 from users to the business model.</p>

<h3>Business model</h3>

<p>The next phase of the process involved some investigation into how we could monetise the platform better. We came up
 with a number of new payment models and picked one which we thought would have the most traction with users. We boldly
 knocked up a fake paywall in a matter of hours using <a href="http://www.bingocardcreator.com/abingo">A/Bingo</a> which we put in
 front of 50% of users over the course of a week. This would allow us to gauge users&rsquo; natural interest in paying for the
 service.</p>

<p>Of course it was possible for us to have called up more employers instead, making no changes to the site. However, we
 decided that testing their behaviour when faced with the real deal was a far more accurate representation than testing
 whether or not they were willing to pay for a service on the phone. Getting feedback from them was key to whether to not
 we would continue developing and refining our business model ideas.</p>

<p>During the latter half of the project, whilst waiting for results from our live-on-site testing, we approached the other
 main user base for the site: jobseekers. What products and features could we offer them to make their life better? We
 journeyed down an innovative path with an idea that we hoped would provide specialised careers advice to PhD and Postdoc
 students looking to move into industry. Interviews were done with students from a number of cities (and countries!), and
 we built a base on which to conduct further experiments.</p>

<h3>Fake it &lsquo;til you make it</h3>

<p>After a surprisingly high click-through rate we spoke to a subset of the users who had been exposed to the paywall. This
 information was easily accessible thanks to the dashboard which had been provided as part of A/Bingo, which we had
 augmented with some details of our own. We called up to around 10% of the users who had viewed the test: those who had
 shown an interest in spending money, those who had instantly been turned-off at the idea of paying for the service, and
 even those who thought that there had been some sort of mistake! Many of those we spoke to were very surprised to
 suddenly presented with payment options, with a few saying that they would no longer use the site if it moved to a more
 premium service. We also learned from customers that we needed to be more rigorous at changing wording across the whole
 site if running a similar test again; many users saw conflicting information on various pages which caused some
 confusion.</p>

<p><img alt="A/Bingo" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47884585/Lean%20Photos/abingo.png" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite an incredible achievement to have prepared, launched and analysed the results of a live feature-fake test on
 a long-running website, with senior executive backing in under 7 days. When we started, we had no idea we&rsquo;d be
 questioning something as important as the business model!</p>

<p>So what this project teach me? Nature Publishing Group (the organisation behind<em>Naturejobs</em>) started the project with a
 vision to create a specific new feature for employers posting jobs on the site and within a few days - and only<strong>tens</strong>
 of interviews - it was clear that this new feature simply was not something users were interested in and that if it were
 provided, they certainly wouldn&rsquo;t pay for it. They say &quot;time is money&rdquo; but in this case we have managed to save
 thousands in development costs in so little time, avoiding building a feature that interviews revealed would have been
 massively under-utilised. It almost seems like common sense when you look back and think about it; validating that your
 customer wants and will pay for your product is a crucial step that should be taken before spending any sum of money on
 development time.</p>

<h2>Lean Startup</h2>

<p>During the course of the<em>Naturejobs</em> project, I also attended the <a href="https://www.leanstartupmachine.com/">Lean Startup
 Machine</a> event over the weekend of 18-20 July, along with <a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/tom-sabin">Tom
 S</a>, <a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/claire-kemp">Claire</a>,
 <a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/richard-stobart">Richard</a>,
 <a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/martyn-evans">Martyn</a>, and Paul (again!) from <a href="http://leanmammoth.com">Lean
 Mammoth</a>. With a strap-line of<em>&ldquo;Learn to build a successful business in three days&rdquo;</em>, the
 workshop is designed to take a simple idea through to a business in an incredibly short amount of time. It consisted of
 a number of workshops to help us validate customer problems and their potential solutions, improve our customer
 development skills, and produce low-fidelity prototypes to put in front of users.</p>

<p>The weekend started with around 20 pitches from those who had come with a pre-existing idea in mind. Participants
 (around 60 in total) then split up into about 12 groups, with each taking on one of the pitched products. Most of us who
 went from Unboxed ended up in different teams, which added a great sense of competition! We spent the rest of the Friday
 evening getting to know our teams, listening to a number of case studies and informative workshops, and designing our
 first experiment. This would allow us to<strong>get out of the building</strong> and out onto the streets of East London first thing
 on the Saturday morning.</p>

<p><img alt="Workshop" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47884585/Lean%20Photos/workshop.JPG" /></p>

<p>The next day we spent a number of hours out around Whitechapel, Bethnal Green and the City, chatting to users out in
 public. I had joined an idea that had come from our team leader Luke (<a href="https://twitter.com/Vitamonth">@Vitamonth</a>),
 which was aimed at trying to guilt people into avoiding their junk food vices. Trust me, it&rsquo;s not easy trying to talk
 to unprepared members of the public about their dietary habits!</p>

<p>By the end of Saturday, we&rsquo;d conducted somewhere in the region of 50 interviews, and narrowed down our target market
 from those actively eating junk food, through those who are much more health-conscious, and eventually settled on people
 who have specifically had problems with dieting in the past. As we felt that we&rsquo;ve found a fit between our problem and
 our customer, we switched into looking for solutions. Using <a href="https://popapp.in/">POP</a>, we managed to create a very basic
 MVP on our personal mobiles within half an hour, so that we could go and test it with users out on the street again. We
 also got a landing page up really quickly using <a href="https://quickmvp.com">QuickMVP</a>, and used our own social networks to
 expose it to as many people online as possible.</p>

<p>Sunday morning had us back out on the streets again, showing our mobile app prototype to anyone we could, getting their
 feedback on how it made them feel and what could be done to improve it. Once we&rsquo;d spoken to enough people, we returned
 to our designated room to create another experiment to test on some more unsuspecting participants.</p>

<p><img alt="Experiment
 Board" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47884585/Lean%20Photos/exp_board.JPG" /></p>

<p>At the end of the weekend, each team was required to present their journey and reflect on what we had achieved. In the
 space of 48 hours, we had converted a simple idea, a Javelin board, and some post-it notes, into:
 - around 70 interviews, all face-to-face on the street
 - 29 email addresses for people we could contact if the app was developed
 - one landing page, and two versions of an interactive MVP</p>

<p>The high point of the weekend however, was actually convincing two members of the public to part with<strong>real</strong> money, in
 exchange for a free beta version of the app!</p>

<p><img alt="Money" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47884585/Lean%20Photos/money.jpg" /></p>

<p>Although it was an exhausting weekend, it was a great experience. We&rsquo;d taken an idea, refined our customer down to a
 specific group of people, and even shown very early versions of it to real people. We validated that people would be
 willing to pay for the product, and avoided adding credence to the statistic that &ldquo;up to 98% startups fail&rdquo;. A great
 video highlighting the event&rsquo;s activities can be found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnLfwRHxvV8">YouTube</a>, and a
 big thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/Koomerang">@koomerang</a> for organising such an insightful weekend!</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed both experiences, and it was a great opportunity for me to develop some skills that I previously
 lacked - mainly those involving speaking to real people! As a developer during other projects, it was certainly a big
 change of pace and refreshing to be part of a small team without the siloing effect of having certain team members with
 fixed roles based on their traditional skill sets.</p>
