            New Apprentice - Shirin
          </h1>

          <div class="blog-article__content">
            <p>In January 2013 I began a pre-apprenticeship programme with Middleton Murray where I was trained for 4 weeks, completing a BTEC in Customer Service and Work Skills, Whilst being at Middleton Murray I have met some inspirational people as well as new people similar age to myself. After my 3 weeks training we had various companies coming in who were taking on apprentice&rsquo;s one of which was Unboxed Consulting! I had been successful and was offered a Office Admin position. It was an amazing offer as I have been struggling to get into any apprenticeship programmes ever since leaving sixth form. I believe that I am very lucky to be given this opportunity as many people in the Generation X are at a high risk of unemployment. I have started at Unboxed Consulting on 18th February 2013, this was my first day we learnt more about the company, the structure, we were introduced to all the staff especially the people we will be working closely with, we set up our laptops including our email, jabber chat and updated our wiki – new employer page. The second day we posted our blogs, updated our bio&rsquo;s and now working on our caricatures, I have also been filling in invoices, filing paperwork, ensuring the work place is neat and tidy and in the meantime I will be fulfilling my duties. I look forward to progressing my knowledge and completing my NVQ in Business &amp; Administration and also meeting new people that Unboxed Consulting are working with.</p>
