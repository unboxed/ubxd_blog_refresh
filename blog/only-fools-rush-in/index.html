          <div class="blog-article__content">
            <p>We recently had an interesting discussion in the internal Unboxed interwebs room regarding an example of inheritance.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/pawel-janiak">Pawel</a> put forth an example about how to guard against someone forgetting to call <code>super</code> in an inheritance chain.</p>

<p>I jumped in to the discussion with the mantra of &ldquo;Composition over Inheritance&rdquo;. Admittedly, I didn&rsquo;t even give the example a good read: I saw a simple inheritance structure and gave an instinctive response.</p>

<h3>Instincts and reflection</h3>

<p>On my commute home, this lingered in the back of my mind. Recently, I have been writing/researching an article on how to continuously improve as a developer and my reaction went against the grain of my thinking on that.</p>

<p>A much better approach would have been to consider all the angles and reflect on the code presented. Sounds pretty evident, right? One of those &ldquo;Monsieur de la Palice was alive fifteen minutes prior to his death&rdquo; deals.</p>

<h3>Let us hear the facts</h3>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s shift our perspective a bit and place ourselves as someone new to the team working on this codebase.</p>

<p>A decision was made to use inheritance and our task for the moment is to guard against neglecting to call <code>super</code> in the initializer for one of subclasses.</p>

<p>What should be our first port of call? Let&rsquo;s look at the test suite. Does the system have one? Is there a scenario to handle this situation? If not, our way forward is simple: we write one.</p>

<p>Now that we have established a secure footing, we can consider whether we are in a position to refactor the inheritance structure. What trade offs would that imply and what benefits would it bring?</p>

<h3>Jumping the gun, are we?</h3>

<p>My response of &ldquo;Composition over Inheritance&rdquo; is a solution to a problem that hadn&rsquo;t yet presented itself.</p>

<p>It betrays a<em>trigger happy</em> attitude by rushing to refactoring. As we are well aware of, refactoring does not happen without tests and without careful consideration of the system as a whole.</p>

<p>Being a good developer is as much about writing good, clean code that is easy to change as it is about the perspective and<strong>attitude</strong> with which we approach a problem.</p>
