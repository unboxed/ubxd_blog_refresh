            Sending S/MIME encrypted emails with Action Mailer
          </h1>

          <div class="blog-article__content">
            <h2>Why send encrypted emails?</h2>

<p>Most people are aware now that sending emails is somewhat akin to sending a postcard - pretty much everyone in the delivery chain is able to have a peek at your message. The only way to prevent this is to encrypt your message so that it appears as gobbledygook to anyone who tries to have a look. In addition to encrypting your email you&rsquo;ll also want to sign it as well to make sure that it hasn&rsquo;t been tampered with in transit.</p>

<p>The de-facto standard for encrypting and signing emails is [S/MIME][1], which has been around for well over a decade now and has wide support in email clients - the exception being the Google Mail web client but it does work fine when accessing Google Mail via IMAP with a client that supports S/MIME.</p>

<p>Support for S/MIME in Ruby comes as part of the OpenSSL standard library. It&rsquo;s very lightly documented but fortunately there&rsquo;s an [example of signing and encrypting][4] an email within the Ruby sample code.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>The technique we will be using to send our encrypted emails is a rarely used feature in Action Mailer called [interceptors][2]. This feature allows you to hook into the email delivery before the email is sent, but after the email has been generated. The definition is straightforward with a single singleton method called <code>delivering_email</code>, e.g:</p>

<p>class MessageInterceptor
 def self.delivering_email(message)
 message.to = [&rsquo;<a href="mailto:test.user@ubxd.com">test.user@ubxd.com</a>&rsquo;]
 end
 end</p>

<p>ActionMailer::Base.register_interceptor(MessageInterceptor)</p>

<p>There are some nifty tricks that can be performed using this feature, one of which is inlining CSS for HTML emails - see [premailer-rails][3] for more information on how to do this.</p>

<h2>Implementing the delivering_email method</h2>

<p>Because of the way interceptors are implemented we have to mutate the message that&rsquo;s passed to our message, therefore we&rsquo;ll create an encrypted version of the message and
 copy the body back onto the original message along with certain headers. The basic outline looks like this:</p>

<p>require &lsquo;openssl&rsquo;</p>

<p>class MessageEncryptor
 class &gt; Notifications.send_invoice(order).deliver</p>

<p>Assuming that all the certificates are in place you should receive an email in short order that is both signed and encrypted. If you&rsquo;re having problems it&rsquo;s almost certainly a mismatch with the certificates - either the trust level of a self-signed certificate isn&rsquo;t high enough or the common name doesn&rsquo;t match the email address.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the complete class:</p>

<p>require &#39;openssl&rsquo;</p>

<p>class MessageEncryptor
 class</p>
