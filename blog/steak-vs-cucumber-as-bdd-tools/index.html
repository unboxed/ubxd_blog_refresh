            Steak vs Cucumber as BDD tools
          </h1>

          <div class="blog-article__content">
            <p>When I joined the world of Ruby on Rails development and testing I was quite happy with all the tools and testing frameworks available, I was using a lot of them during development process. Words like Rspec and Cucumber quickly became part of my vocabulary, along with other &lsquo;magic&rsquo; words like Kanban and Scrum. BDD, or &rsquo; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development">Behaviour Driven Development</a>&rsquo;&nbsp;became a permanent part of my life!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s crucial for a project, that the features that a customer would like to have implemented into the finished product are captured as well defined stories early on. We&rsquo;ll eventually use these stories as a template for our tests. Cucumber is an especially good tool for using these stories as templates for testing. So what is Cucumber and what does it look like?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the explanation on <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki">Cucumber&rsquo;s own wiki</a>.</p>

<p>Cucumber is a tool that executes plain-text functional descriptions as automated tests. The language that Cucumber understands is called Gherkin.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/868229.js?file=cucumber_feature.feature"></script>

<p>As you can see, Cucumber allows you to easily describe the behaviour of your new feature. In fact, it&rsquo;s that good that some of our customers are using Cucumber descriptions as the acceptance criteria on their project&rsquo;s stories. So where&rsquo;s the catch? Well, not everything in cucumber is as easy as it may look. Even though cucumber has lot of pre-defined &ldquo;phrases&rdquo; to describe the behaviour of an application, you soon find out that sometimes it can be really tricky to preserve the readability of stories that are more complex than just: &ldquo;And I should see &#39;a yellow box&rdquo; for example. When it gets tricky it gets really time consuming. And even if you know that implementing the related functionality is really easy - writing the proper, readable cucumber test that makes sense is sometimes very hard.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not complaining about writing tests in general. I&rsquo;m complaining about how hard it is sometimes to achieve basic readability of tests! Does the average customer really have to understand the tests we use? If they do, then ok - I&rsquo;m here and I&rsquo;m prepared to write those nice, readable tests for them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But what if they don&rsquo;t care? Well there is another way around: the solution is called Steak.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So what is <a href="https://github.com/cavalle/steak">Steak</a>?</p>

<p>Steak is an Acceptance BDD solution (like Cucumber) but in plain ol&rsquo; Ruby. This is how an acceptance spec looks in Steak&hellip;</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/868232.js?file=steak.rb"></script>

<p>As you can see, there is a Feature description and a Scenario description, but the rest is Ruby language with Capybara syntax. But why do I think this is so special, and why do I think you should use it? Well it&rsquo;s much, much faster to write those complex, yet readable tests, and it&rsquo;s easy to maintain.</p>

<p>Recently, I was working on a tough project where I was the only back-end developer and there was one front-end developer; let&rsquo;s call him Tom. At the start of this project we were using Cucumber. It took such a long time to write some of the tests, and because there were a lot of front end changes, we had to fix and re-write a lot of these Cucumber tests. Tom found he wasn&rsquo;t that comfortable writing Cucumber scenarios, so it took him longer to fix them. At the start of the new iteration, I decided to use Steak instead of Cucumber. I discussed with Tom how Steak works, and he preferred it immediately. We started implementing new stories and development suddenly went really well and much quicker. I was writing Steak stories much faster, and Tom was faster too. So, by the end of the iteration there was no complaining about fixing Cucumber stories, and there was a lot more delivered functionality; them were some good times.</p>

<p>Is it Steak final solution?</p>

<p>Maybe, maybe not. It really depends on you and your customer&rsquo;s needs, but what you really should do is to try it out yourself. You will see how much faster your development process can became.</p>
