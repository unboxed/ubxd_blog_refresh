            The Week That Was
          </h1>

          <div class="blog-article__content">
            <p>Welcome to this weeks installment. @jpawlyn submits for your consideration the following tasty crumpets from the land of tech.</p>

<h2>Mac OS</h2>

<h3>View plain text files without a file extension - @sren via @markscholtz and @Iron_Matt</h3>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/whomwah/qlstephen">QuickLook plugin</a> that lets you view plain text files without a file extension.</p>

<h2>Rails</h2>

<h3>RailsConf 2012 - @hlame</h3>

<p>This week I watched 3 of the keynotes from RailsConf 2012:</p>

<ul>
<li>DHH on <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/854-railsconf2012-keynote-progress">Progress</a></li>
<li>Aaron Patterson on <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/880-railsconf2012-keynote-i-ve-made-a-huge-mistake">I&rsquo;ve made a huge mistake</a></li>
<li>Yehuda Katz on <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/907-railsconf2012-rails-the-next-five-years">Rails: The next five years</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I would genuinely say don&rsquo;t bother. DHH goes on for way too long without really saying anything other than progress means change, Rails 4 will change, Rails 4 will break things, but it will be better so stop complaining and just live with it. Also, in characteristic style, he tells you to fuck off if you don&rsquo;t agree.</p>

<p>Aaron Patterson basically skirts around the same issues in much less time, actually, I struggle to remember what his point was.</p>

<p>Finally, Yehuda actually spends most of his talk speaking about the past 5 years of Rails and where it&rsquo;s been rather than where it&rsquo;s going. He makes some good points about (again) not complaining when something appears in Rails that you don&rsquo;t like, or don&rsquo;t think should be part of the core. It&rsquo;s usually a good idea so that things get wide usage and standardised to work out the bugs. It&rsquo;s not till the last quarter of the talk that he mentions some things that might go into the next versions of Rails (JSON serializers as first class objects), but it&rsquo;s hardly &ldquo;next five years&rdquo;, I&rsquo;d argue that it&rsquo;s not even &ldquo;next five months&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Anyway, there are loads of other talks to watch online and I&rsquo;d say that these 3 keynotes aren&rsquo;t worth your time. There are some good points in them, but not enough to warrant spending the ~2hrs it would take to watch all 3; seek out some write-ups and notes and you&rsquo;ll get all the good points much quicker.</p>

<h3>CanCan - Grant</h3>

<p>I really love this library and usually use it by default on all my personal projects plus I usually update my controller generators to use this by default. 
 So I recommend we use this on all our new projects :)</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ryanb/cancan">CanCan</a> is an authorization library for Ruby on Rails which restricts what resources a given user is allowed to access. All permissions are defined in a single location (the Ability class) and not duplicated across controllers, views, and database queries.</p>

<h2>Markup and Javascript</h2>

<h3>Maps - Joerge boy</h3>

<p>If we want to use maps - we are not limited to Google. Even if we have written a lot of javascript code already that deals with the Google Maps API - that&rsquo;s not a problem. Because - part of the Google API - version 3 at least - you can swap out the mapping tiles for more attractive looking tiles - either from OpenStreetMap (OSM) directly - or for even more attractive tiles from Stamen.</p>

<p><a href="http://maps.stamen.com">http://maps.stamen.com</a></p>

<p>Just add the following code where you fire up maps, and drool over the difference.</p>

<p>// replace &ldquo;toner&rdquo; here with &ldquo;terrain&rdquo; or &ldquo;watercolor&rdquo;
 var layer = &ldquo;toner&rdquo;;
 var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById(&ldquo;element_id&rdquo;), {
 center: new google.maps.LatLng(37.7, -122.4),
 zoom: 12,
 mapTypeId: layer,
 mapTypeControlOptions: {
 mapTypeIds: [layer]
 }
 });
 map.mapTypes.set(layer, new google.maps.StamenMapType(layer));</p>

<h3>Ripple Effect - Matt P</h3>

<p>A few weeks ago I discovered this gem (no, not the ruby kind) via twitter:
 - <a href="http://alligator.github.com/lake.js/">How to add an animated ripple effect to water images</a></p>

<h3>WTFWG - Carl</h3>

<p>Hacker news continues to play the role of daily mail for devs and I do so love standardisation rage bait.</p>

<p>srcset gets in over picture QQ</p>

<p><a href="http://timkadlec.com/2012/05/wtfwg/">http://timkadlec.com/2012/05/wtfwg/</a></p>

<h2>Programming and Architecture</h2>

<h3>State Machines - Tony</h3>

<p>Was a nice recap on <a href="http://blog.markwshead.com/869/state-machines-computer-science/">state machines</a>. It&rsquo;s a good thing for everyone to know and I&rsquo;ve seen too many projects with complicated processes which would be more appropriate with a state machine.</p>

<h3>Smorgasbord - @Iron_Matt</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/240000393">Ward Cunningham</a> interviewed on the occasion of winning the Dr Dobb&rsquo;s Excellence In Programming Award.
 Wiki inventor, Agile Manifesto co-signatory, Smalltalk ninja, Sublime Text 2 user and undoubted troll-bait for Tilly due to his love for CoffeeScript<em>and</em> node.js.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/227400034">&lsquo;Brogrammer&rsquo;? &#39;Rock Star&rsquo;?</a> Thanks but I&rsquo;d rather collaborate with <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/227400034?pgno=2">these folk</a>
 Especially Larry Wall, King of the Hawaiian Shirt-sported-in-the-workplace</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been documenting <a href="https://wiki.unboxedconsulting.com/wiki/Non-functional_Requirements">Non-functional Requirements</a> on our wiki as part of the ISO9001 work. All contributions are welcome. Just imagine if there were actual flaming torches on the wall monitoring our hardware&hellip;</p>

<h3>Rating Systems - Matt P</h3>

<p>Imagine you have a site with some form of voting or rating sytem. How should you sort the rated items? Your probable initial guess of &ldquo;just calculate the average&rdquo; is wrong - see why by reading <a href="http://evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html">this</a> 
 (This one happily contains a ruby fragment)</p>

<h2>DBs</h2>

<h3>Goodbye MongoDB - Carl</h3>

<p>Everyone seems to be hating on mongo right now and having been in a similar situation I can sympathise with the reasoning behind <a href="http://www.zopyx.de/blog/goodbye-mongodb">this article</a>.</p>

<p>When someone from your database vendor comes into your office and suggests you throw more tin at a problem, you&rsquo;re in trouble.</p>

<h2>Sysadmin</h2>

<h3>Server monitoring - @sren via @Iron_Matt</h3>

<p>A <a href="http://nerds.airbnb.com/monitoring-your-serverswith-fire">nice post</a> from AirBnB about monitoring servers with fire lamps.
 Harnessing the power of the elements for the purpose of monitoring is a brilliant way to focus teams on NFRs.</p>

<h2>Notices</h2>

<h3>7 Languages in 7 Weeks - Matt P</h3>

<p>Starting next Wednesday, I will be undertaking a project called 7 Languages in 7 Weeks. 1-2 hours over 3 days is all that&rsquo;s required so if you are looking for another time-sink then look no further! It&rsquo;s currently me and 2 other friends taking part, but any one else interested would be more than welcome. We&rsquo;ll be covering Ruby, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, Clojure and Haskell, and no prior experience in any of the languages is required. I&rsquo;ve brought the book in with me today, for if anybody wants to take a gander.</p>
