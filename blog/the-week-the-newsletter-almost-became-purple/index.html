            The Week The Newsletter Almost Became Purple
          </h1>

          <div class="blog-article__content">
            <p>First things first: Bender, our lovely campfire bot, now knows how to choose a newsletter author. It works on top of the existing lists api and removes you once you&rsquo;ve been chosen. I think it&rsquo;s time he made an appearance in the dev chat room&hellip;</p>

<p>But, without further ado:</p>

<h2>xip.io (Andrew)</h2>

<p><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3191-announcing-pow-040-with-xipio-support">http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3191-announcing-pow-040-with-xipio-support</a></p>

<p>37 Signals last week released the latest version of Pow with support for xib.io, 37 Signals wildcard DNS. You can go read about xip in last weeks newsletter.</p>

<h2>Place Kitten (Matt P)</h2>

<p>In response to my threatening to bomb the newsletter with lolcats I received the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, since you hinted at cats, I have this one to share:
<a href="http://placekitten.com/">http://placekitten.com/</a> - stock images of kittens, sizeable to whatever size you can need. Useful when mocking up a site. Like the lorem ipsum, but with images.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Kogan&rsquo;s IE7 Tax (Matt P)</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s one that did the rounds on twitter yesterday: <a href="http://www.kogan.com/au/blog/new-internet-explorer-7-tax">http://www.kogan.com/au/blog/new-internet-explorer-7-tax</a> - it encourages people to use a sensible browser by inflating prices when IE7 is used. It doesn&rsquo;t say how it handles IE6 (or below)&hellip;</p>

<h2>Mina (Murray)</h2>

<p>An alternative to capistrano that, for a change, actually seems to have some benefit: <a href="http://nadarei.co/mina/">http://nadarei.co/mina/</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve not actually investigated beyond the readme but it also appears to not have quite so many railsy features as capistrano, which could be a good thing if your app is non-standard or non-rails.</p>

<h2>Angular.js (Rob F)</h2>

<p>Angular.js has reached 1.0. It&rsquo;s an interesting alternative to the internet&rsquo;s darling Backbone and supports declaritive view binding. It comes out of google and apparently has been engineered quite well. I heard that the library earned full time development by winning a bet that an existing application that took 3 months to rebuild could be rebuilt using Angular in 3 weeks. The team won the bet and now work full time on Angular for Google. Or so I&rsquo;ve heard&hellip;</p>

<h2>Canvas Hands On (Rob F)</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been toying with a game idea I want to develop, and to prototype it I&rsquo;ve turned to canvas, but I wanted some neato effects. This tutorial walks you through rendering fireworks to the canvas. It also touches on the requestAnimationFrame API which is a must for smooth animations in browsers. Watch out for my game!</p>

<h2>Javascript Garden (Rob F)</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing some actual JS development this week. I&rsquo;m not sure how many of us use JS for more than just $.animate, but JS Garden is a great read of all of the gotchas of Javascript and how to do things the right way.</p>

<h2>Zed A. Shaw - The Web Will Die When OOP Dies</h2>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/43380467">https://vimeo.com/43380467</a></p>

<p>Thought-provoking talk by Zed Shaw given at the Web Rebels 2012 conference in Norway. Being Zed Shaw, expect profanity and controversial ideas that you probably won&rsquo;t agree with. Nevertheless I think there are some very good insights in there, especially in his discussion of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and how in a perfect world, we wouldn&rsquo;t need to work around the huge limitations of these technologies.</p>

<h2>A Haskell Talk (Muz)</h2>

<p>Haskell Talk: <a href="http://yow.eventer.com/events/1004/talks/1054">http://yow.eventer.com/events/1004/talks/1054</a></p>

<p>I know we&rsquo;re all mostly ruby and javascript, so we&rsquo;re all &ldquo;Types, LOL!!!!&rdquo;, but this talk about Haskell is really good. It&rsquo;s a good historical overview of haskell and gives good reasons for why types and pure functional programming might be the way forward. I&rsquo;ve not done any Haskell, but after this talk I&rsquo;m more inclined to look into it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also a good talk to watch to get some speaking tips. This guy is really charming and enthusiastic, and that can get you a long way towards taking the audience with you on a complicated journey.</p>

<h2>Haskell Platform 2012.2.0 released (Luke R)</h2>

<p><a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/?2012.2.0.0">http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/?2012.2.0.0</a></p>

<p>For those prompted to try Haskell after Murray&rsquo;s submission, the good news is that a new release of the Haskell Platform (the easiest way to get started with Haskell) came out recently and has GHC 7.4.</p>
