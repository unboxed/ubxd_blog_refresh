<p>Unboxed Consulting, a leading agile consulting and web development consultancy, has today announced that, following record breaking demand for its services, it is to open a new office in Cape Town, South Africa.&nbsp;This new office continues the company’s global expansion with presence in North America, as well as its headquarters within ‘The City’, in London.

<p>Richard Stobart, managing director, said of the expansion; “Despite the global recession we have seen an increase in revenues and demand for our Agile consulting and development services from across a variety of sectors and regions over the last two years.&nbsp;As we get closer to our fifth birthday in April, we are very proud of the 30-strong company, our reputation and clientbase that we have built up – now more than ever before, customers of all sizes are seeing the speed with which Agile development practices can deliver value to their business.”</p>

<p>The new office will start immediate work on development projects for Unboxed Consulting’s existing client base.</p>

<p>Stobart added; “There is great demand in South Africa for high quality software development, and Cape Town was a natural choice for us as a base.&nbsp;The city has developers of the high standard Unboxed Consulting customers are used to getting – our new and existing global customers will benefit from the skills the new team brings to the company.”</p>
