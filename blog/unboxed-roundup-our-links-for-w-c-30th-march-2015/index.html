            <h2>The modern bank robbery - <a href="https://twitter.com/tadas_t">Tadas T</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/world/bank-hackers-steal-millions-via-malware.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/world/bank-hackers-steal-millions-via-malware.html</a></p>

<p>With GitHub&rsquo;s recent DDoS attack and Slack hacking media is starting to take cybercrime more seriously and writes more about these topics. However this is a terrible yet fascinating story that deserves more attention about what has to be the most sophisticated bank robbery to date.</p>

<h2>Tickets for Restaurants - <a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/murray-steele">Murray S</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://website.alinearestaurant.com/site/2014/06/tickets-for-restaurants/">http://website.alinearestaurant.com/site/2014/06/tickets-for-restaurants/</a></p>

<p>This article is a long post-mortem by the owner of a handful of restaurants, mostly in Chicago, about their switch from standard reservations via phone and sites like OpenTable to a new tickets-based solution. Interestingly instead of using existing software providers they decided to develop the new solution in-house to meet their exact requirements. I read this because I like eating in fancy restaurants and have bookmarked these restaurants to visit if I ever take a trip to Chicago. What I enjoyed most though is that this is a story about exactly the kind of software development I was promised when I first started coding many years ago: building custom software for engaged clients that know their business with a shared goal of helping them serve their customers better. We often get caught up in writing software for its own sake and can lose sight of why we&rsquo;re writing it in the first place. For me this article was a good reminder.</p>

<h2>Stop using <code>tail -f</code> - <a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/neil-van-beinum">Neil vB</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.brianstorti.com/stop-using-tail/">http://www.brianstorti.com/stop-using-tail/</a></p>

<p>Using &lsquo;tail -f&rsquo; to monitor log files is useful but it&rsquo;s hard to search the log. This post suggests the use of &#39;less +F&rsquo; so that you can easily switch between logging and navigation. </p>

<h2>A JS physics engine for touch interactions - <a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/henry-turner">Henry T</a></h2>

<p>Hopefully little pieces like this will make non-native apps easier to use and write.</p>

<h2>Why everything breaks when you reach 25 employees - <a href="https://twitter.com/tadas_t">Tadas T</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://getlighthouse.com/blog/company-growth-everything-breaks-25-employees/">https://getlighthouse.com/blog/company-growth-everything-breaks-25-employees/</a> </p>

<p>This article analyses the reasons behind the chaos caused by the initial company growth stage. Having witnessed this effect myself I found this article very insightful. Understanding the possible reasons behind it will hopefully help to address the problems better next time.</p>

<h2>Track of the Week - <a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/paula-stepinska">Paula S</a></h2>

<p>There are so many tracks that deeply move me, but not so many that always make me laugh. But I know I can always count on these guys:</p>
