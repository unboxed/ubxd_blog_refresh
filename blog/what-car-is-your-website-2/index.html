            What car is your website?

<p>I was driving the family back from Lucca in Tuscany to catch our flight from Genova when a thought struck me. Car manufacturers segment their markets looking for large niches. &nbsp;Large enough to attract enough customers worldwide but unique enough to differentiate themselves from the competition. &nbsp;I have sat with customers as they try to define the tone and style of their website. We often work with customers who are building a website from scratch so we are working from a blank canvas which in some ways makes things easier but usually the brand identity and site functionality emerge together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We want a quality brand and we want that to come across in our website” our customer will say. This is where my new idea comes in.</p>

<p>“If your site was a car, what car would it be and what colour would it be?” I proffer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Well, our product is the best!” counter the customer.</p>

<p>“So are we talking Rolls Royce or Bugatti Veyron?”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Well those cars are in an inaccessible league that very few can afford. &nbsp;Our site offers value.”</p>

<p>“So how about a Mercedes S class or BMW 7 series?”</p>

<p>“Those cars are executive cars, we are selling to middle class families.”</p>

<p>“Larger families, with older parents? &nbsp;How about a Volvo XC90 or a Audi Q7”</p>

<p>“No. &nbsp;Our family would be ecologically friendly. &nbsp;They would drive the Lexus 400h Hybrid. &nbsp;In black.</p>

<p>“That’s it! &nbsp;Our site is a black Lexus 400h.”</p>

<p>I wonder if there is a way to reference the Toyota Way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If your site was a car, what car would it be? &nbsp;What car is our Unboxed Consulting site? &nbsp;A convertible VW Beetle with custom painted flowers or the Audi S4 in charcoal?</p>
