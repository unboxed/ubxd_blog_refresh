Richard Stobart, managing director, said of the expansion; “Despite the global recession we have seen an increase in revenues and demand for our Agile consulting and development services from across a variety of sectors and regions over the last two years.&nbsp;As we get closer to our fifth birthday in April, we are very proud of the 30-strong company, our reputation and clientbase that we have built up – now more than ever before, customers of all sizes are seeing the speed with which Agile development practices can deliver value to their business.”

The new office will start immediate work on development projects for Unboxed Consulting’s existing client base.

Stobart added; “There is great demand in South Africa for high quality software development, and Cape Town was a natural choice for us as a base.&nbsp;The city has developers of the high standard Unboxed Consulting customers are used to getting – our new and existing global customers will benefit from the skills the new team brings to the company.”
