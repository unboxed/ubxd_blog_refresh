We have had a code review carried out on one of the projects we are currently working on,&nbsp; [channel5.com](http://www.channel5.com), by an external party.&nbsp; [Xavier Noria](http://www.hashref.com) has looked at the code and has given us a glowing report which Channel 5 are very happy with.&nbsp;

The overriding conclusion of the report is that '_The quality of the reviewed source code is very good, it uses idiomatic Ruby and idiomatic Rails, and overall it follows best practices'._

Additionally, Xavier makes some suggestions that we will be applying to future developments.
