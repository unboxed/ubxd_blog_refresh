## Ruby 2.0.0 is out! - [Matt P](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/matt-peperell) [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/24/ruby-2-0-0-p0-is-released/](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/24/ruby-2-0-0-p0-is-released/)

## ..and a shameless plug for [Ruby Manor 4](http://rubymanor.org/4/) - [Murray S](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/murray-steele)

[Ruby Manor 4](http://rubymanor.org/4/): CFP closes Monday 4th, Voting starts shortly after.

The ruby conference I'm co-organising might be sold out, but that doesn't mean you can't get in! All our speakers will be given a ticket if they don't have one. The CFP closes on Monday 4th, so there's still time to propose a talk: [http://vestibule.rubymanor.org/proposals/new](http://vestibule.rubymanor.org/proposals/new). The CFP is completely open and anonymous, so even if you're not going to propose something, you should sign up and leave some comments. In a few days time we'll open up voting and let the community pick the talks they want to see on the day. If you don't have a ticket, you can still get involved and vote as we film all the talks and release them to the world, so your opinions are still valid.

## ActiveSupport::MethodOfTheWeek - [Andrew M](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/andrew-mitchell) Do you find yourself regularly repeating specific sets of options when you are writing your code. `with_options` might help make things a little more dry and a little easier to read.

Read the name of this site carefully. Visit it, sure, but do not leave it open in a tab unless you're using Firefox. OK, now that the warnings are out of the way I shall explain a little bit more. It's a site which gives an endless stream of cats (who doesn't love such sites?) using the HTML 5 localStorage. There are problems with the implementations of many popular browsers meaning that this storage can be abused. More details explained on the site. Dare you click?
