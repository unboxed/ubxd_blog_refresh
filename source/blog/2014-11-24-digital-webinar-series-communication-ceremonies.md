## Topics covered included:
 • How to put the audience at ease  
 • How to encourage feedback  
 • Who to invite and what to  
 • Passive, continual and transparent communication  
  

## Among the insights shared were:
 • Get the Product Owner to run the Show and Tell - get them to cover what was delivered and what you plan to deliver next, actively encourage feedback  
 • Show the features you have delivered, those you planned and didn't deliver, and those you're doing next  
 • Rehearse your show and tell - create a story from the stories, make it quick and easy to understand  
 • Present journeys of upcoming stories so stakeholders can see what’s coming visually  
 • Looking for signs of success  
 • Watch the Product Owner’s language change from 'the product' to 'our product' - that's when there is ownership  
 • Get your same team fully committed to your project by committing to and delivering a retrospective every two weeks, without fail  

## Tips for the most successful two-weekly retrospectives included:
 • Start retrospective with the [Retrospective Prime Directive](http://www.retrospectives.com/pages/retroPrimeDirective.html)  
 • Make it short, sharp and FULL of trust + collaboration  
 • Have passive communication mechanisms in the form of information radiators  
 • Task board  
 • Burn down for the sprint  
 • Burn up for the backlog  
 • Have your customer journey as wireframes and work in progress up on the walls - anyone who is interested can come and interact
