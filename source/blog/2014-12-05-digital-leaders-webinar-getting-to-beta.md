## Topics covered included:
 • Understanding Beta, knowing what you’re trying to achieve  
 • What you should be achieving in Alpha and Beta  
 • How to learn to see if it’s worth investing in this stage  
 • The activities covered Alpha and Beta  
 • The risk of this stage  
 • Using the feedback from your customers  
  

## Among the insights shared were:
 • Alpha is about getting to the start of Beta, understanding all the things that will de-rail you  
 • What you want is a shared vision of what you’re building to be established and embedded within the team  
 • Once you’ve got real-life customers, you’re in a different level of risk  
 • Alpha is about **DE** fining your service, Beta is about **RE** fining it  
 • The important things to put in place for your Beta team: your technology, your larger team, your roadmap of the build, your onboard strategy for your service, metric gathering to put in place

## Tips for successful Beta teams:
 • Prepare the core elements and understand what you have to do in the Beta stage  
 • Establish the purpose and culture of your team  
 • Test the risk, make sure your users can get through and provide feedback  
 • Look at key metrics which influence your service  
 • Run real customers through your full service and then get feedback – talk to your customers, know them, know them better than they know themselves and know exactly how they use your service
