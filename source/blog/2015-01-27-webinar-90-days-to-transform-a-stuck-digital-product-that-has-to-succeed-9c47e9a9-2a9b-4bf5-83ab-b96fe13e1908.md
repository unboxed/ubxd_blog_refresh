## Topics covered included:
 • Roadmapping  
 • What not to do and how to untie your hands so you’re doing things as effectively and efficiently as possible  
 • Aligning your team – empowering them and removing the blockers  
 • Getting the code-base in a position to develop on, changing your pace and direction  
 • Getting this into production and hitting the big risks with this software  
 • The process of putting into development  
  


Among the insights shared were:  

## Get your teams structured in a more efficient way:
 • Imagine your development team as being an efficient sausage machine, and your functional requirements that go into that machine are, as quickly as possible, being produced as sausages

• What not to do: throw more developers at a problem - it’s about communication, not speed of typing  
 • Your production pipeline is similar to the flow of traffic on a motorway – as you start adding cars to that motorway, the average speed starts dropping  
 • Reduce the amount the team is working on, get them to deliver a very small handful of things to start getting loosely delivering  
 • Look at all the meetings that your team are having – if they’re nothing to do with their current piece of work then either cancel or schedule for a day of the week that doesn’t disrupt the rest of the team  
 • If you’re going to have long-term planning sessions, time-box them and realise that there’s limited value in planning months and months ahead because things will change
