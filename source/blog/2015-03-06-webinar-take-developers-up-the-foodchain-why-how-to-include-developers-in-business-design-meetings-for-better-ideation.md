## Topics covered included:
 • The unspoken reasons developers can be excluded  
 • Insights a developer can provide that other participants can’t  
 • Security and privacy  
 • Integrating design within the design process  
 • Initial design meetings  
 • The role of a senior developer in a first meeting  
  

## Amongst these topics, Andrew shared insights:
 • Customers prefer to be spoken to honestly than be subject to hand waving  
 • You should include developers as they can provide insights that other participants can't  
 • Developers are some of the largest users of digital products and services so by including them you can gain access to a sophisticated user that may represent your target market  
 • Including developers can help make design part of the whole iterative process, where it can move from low to high fidelity as the development progresses
