[Carlo Kruger](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/carlo-kruger) hosted the final webinar in the _#StrongerAgile_ series, titled _‘Offshoring Agile: Make it work in practice’_, live from our Cape Town office. Despite the belief that Agile can’t work offshore, this webinar explains how it can flourish with the right mindset, processes and relationship.

## The audio of the full session:

## Topics covered included:
 • Communication, culture and trust in an Agile environment  
 • How do we build relationships with people we don't have face-to-face contact with?  
 • What can be done to enhance and improve communication  
 • Tooling  
 • Video conferencing  
 • Remote pairing working within distributed development teams  
 • Facilitation of meetings  
  

## Amongst these topics, Carlo shared insights:
 • There has always been a greater demand of software developers than the available supply  
 • There is a measurable bias in all online communications  
 • In remote communication, we lose the opportunity for small talk  
 • Both sides of conversation need approximately 30 megabits per second  
 • Video conferencing has had a big impact on the clarity of communication  
 • The idea of pairing becomes important when it comes to team composition  
 • More open and inclusive platforms, than email, make for a better channel of communication around decisions in projects  
 • High-quality communication equipment can make a massive difference to meetings with multiple people in the room  
 • Having a conversation with someone not in the same room is much more cognitively taxing than the equivalent conversation in the same room  
 • Make sure that people are prepared for meetings - use live online tools such as Trello, Whiteboard and Google Presentation, so people can **know** when you're referring to something in the discussion
