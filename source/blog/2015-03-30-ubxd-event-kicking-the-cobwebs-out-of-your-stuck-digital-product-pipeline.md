author: "Graeme McCubbin"

---

Four insightful speakers and a fantastic audience – Wednesday 25th March was our _‘Unstick your digital products’_ event, in Central London.

This energetic three-hour session was attended by heads of industry and explored the techniques to:  
  
 • Accelerate a product buried under multiple features  
 • Get a large product portfolio moving again  
 • Move faster to catch up with a competitor  
 • Get traction in a non-Agile organisation  
 • Focus limited resources on what will create most value  


The morning kicked off with a colourful paper aeroplane-based exercise:

 The session then began:  

## Talk 1:_“Trust me, I’m a product manager”_: case study from publishing
 Dave Evans, Product Manager (E-commerce), at [Nature Publishing Group] (http://www.nature.com) kicked off the talks with a case study, diving into the publishing sector. He discussed the hypothetical first 5 days of a journey as a Product Manager:

• Understand the people and players involved in the products  
 • Establish where the value lies within your products  
 • See where the money is and how your product is doing financially  
 • Introduce Agile and Scrum, then see different teams adopting these processes, quick delivery, learning and iterating  
 • Properly validate your roadmap, make sure you’ve done research and know things you are adding will add value

## Talk 2: How designing a new experience in the NHS helped to unblock and unleash new potential
 The second session was led by [Glyn Parry](https://twitter.com/G\_Parry24), Programme Manager of [SH:24](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/case-studies/sh24) – a community interested company which partners with the NHS.  
  
 Glyn shared the insight into why an iterative and Agile approach has been used to turn STI testing on its head - challenging deep seated practices and prejudices in the NHS and local authorities:

• Don’t assume that organisations aren’t Agile, there are people who are instinctively Agile  
 • Identify those in the organisation who have an Agile mindset and are quite influential  
 • Do take some risks

• Project managers want to control risk, so try and take control of the whole project  
 • Take a large product portfolio that has got stuck, ask yourself “what does it take to get momentum going again?”  
 • Work with the governance process rather than against them  
 • Short term thinking - focus around users, engage stakeholders and show them what can be done rapidly  
 • Focus limited resources on creating the best value  
 • Get the product out there; share it, however scrappy and unfinished it is

## Talk 4: Techniques for overcoming the top digital product blockers
 Last, but by no means least, was [Richard Stobart](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/richard-stobart). Richard spoke through the exact reasons as to why digital products get stuck and explored the techniques and methods to speed them back up again:

• Get stakeholders to buy in, using their language and get committees set up - clear the way  
 • Don’t be afraid to stop - pause for 3 months while and gather your thoughts, stopping is a very good thing to do, it makes people wake up  
 • Build the smallest thing you can, but the highest value things only
