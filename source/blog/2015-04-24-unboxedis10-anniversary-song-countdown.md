As we celebrate our 10th birthday next week, we thought we'd look back at what song was riding high as UK #1 on 29th April 2005. Much to our surprise, it was Peter Kay singing _‘Is This The Way To Amarillo?’_ along with Tony Christie, wearing a purple suit and a jazzy shirt to go with it (are you sure this isn't you in the video, [Richard](https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/richard-stobart)?):

 I thought it would make for some good nostalgia to look back at what the UK #1 song was on the birthday of 10 Unboxed people, then get a few words from them on their _“anniversary”_ song.  


So we start the countdown...  
  
 ##10. [Sarah](https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/sarah-beck):

## Sonia - You'll Never Stop Me Loving You

<font size="2"><font color="#91278f">Claire's comment: </font></font>_“This is the beat for CPR repetition. I had a 70's party for my 21st, we played it. I also still like to listen to it but not too often!"_  
  


##8. [Shirin](https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/shirin-ullah):

<font size="2"><font color="#91278f">Tyler's comment:</font></font> _"'Don’t tell me it’s not worth fighting for.' Wise words, Bryan Adams. This song has two guitar solos in it. How rad is that? (Shortcuts - 2:43 onwards & 4:50)"._  
  


##5. [Tom S](https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/tom-sabin):

<font size="2"><font color="#91278f">Graeme's comment:</font></font> _"This song gives me the creeps... Given the choice, I'd definitely go for the US #1 on my birthday, [Paula Abdul - Straight Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El1kgCqD7Xk).

<font size="2"><font color="#91278f">Carrie's comment:</font></font> _"It's not true that I don't like Mondays. But I **do** like rats and I think they should have more weekday opportunities for fun and dancing. So in that way it is an entirely accurate predictor of my personality and world view."_  
  


And we've hit the last song in the countdown...
