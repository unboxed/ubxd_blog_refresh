[Richard Stobart](https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/richard-stobart) kicked off our _SpeedAgile_ webinar series, with the first session: _‘Speed up stakeholder communication and sign off’_.

In this 30-minute webinar, Richard explored:  


* Rapidly engaging and building confidence with your stakeholders  
* Creating momentum on the features you really need  
* Applying communication ceremonies that give everyone clarity  
* Helping slice through a complex stakeholder decision-making unit

## Topics covered included:


* Getting communication going between stakeholders at the start of the process and getting sign off at the end  
* Beginning a journey with stakeholders  
* Engaging people within the journey  
* Starting with the basics, before ramping up  
* The [_“Development Sausage Machine”_](https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/blog/the-sausage-machine)  
* Taking feedback on board and using this  
* The various different types of stakeholders  
* Measuring though t-shirt sizing for value  
  

## Other insights shared:


* Take your stakeholders on a journey, increase their level of comfort and build trust so they trust what you say – as this relationship builds and improves, then get them excited  
* Go as fast as you can, take risks but land safely  
* Put the person in an environment where they can learn as fast as possible, and don’t feel out of their depth  
* You don’t want to be in a situation where stakeholders feel like they’re fighting you all the time and they aren’t being heard  
* Once your stakeholders are engaged, you can take off the training wheels and hand it over to them – you’ve taken them through a secure, safe process  
* The most critical thing is continual improvement
