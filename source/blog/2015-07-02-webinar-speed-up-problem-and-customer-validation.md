## Topics covered included:
 \* Does the problem exist? Will our solution solve it? Will people pay for it? \* Validating your personas \* The interviewing process – how to get the most out of each round \* Applying a scientific approach to interviewing and the Lean Startup approach \* Structured personas and breaking these down \* MVPs (Minimal Viable Products) and the different types \* Paper prototyping  
  

## Other insights shared:
 \* Interview people who give you the insights, the people who experience the problem that you think you’re going to solve \* Identify your assumptions, go out and talk to people \* Prepare for your interviews by knowing your goals ahead of time \* Encourage the end user to talk by using open-ended questions \* Measure the success of an interview by how much you’re listening and not talking – get the chance to hear what the end user has to say \* The key thing about hypothesis: You need to know what you’re looking for, what result will make it valid or invalid? \* Have minimum documentation – take the key pieces that people have strong opinions on, put these on paper, make any notes and share this with the team \* Keep iterating, keep revisiting – this will form a deep understanding of your customer and what’s of most value to them \* There is nothing that replaces hearing the problems you’re trying to solve than directly from the customer’s mouth
