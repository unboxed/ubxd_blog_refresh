## A clear view through future nonsense - [Martyn E](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/martyn-evans)

http://idlewords.com/talks/web_design_first_100_years.htm

Rather than waiting passively for technology to change the world, let's see how much we can do with what we already have.

## Choose Boring Technology - [Tadas T](https://twitter.com/tadas_t)

https://speakerdeck.com/mcfunley/choose-boring-technology

Dan McKinley talks about focus on product, and what does it actually mean to choose the right tool for the job (sneak peek: it's not what's trending on Hacker News).

## DDD 10 years on - [Patrick V](http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/people/patrick-vine)

http://www.se-radio.net/2015/05/se-radio-episode-226-eric-evans-on-domain-driven-design-at-10-years/

Software Engineering Radio talks to Eric Evans 10 years after his Domain Driven Design book was released.  There is an interesting discussion on how the community has grown and the architectural evolutions that have grown out of DDD and contribute to how it is perceived today.  I particularly enjoy the opening description of DDD which is what Eric intended by DDD but so many people didn't read far enough into the book to read and hence fully understand.
